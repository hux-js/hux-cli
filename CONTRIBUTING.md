# Contrax Contributing Guide

Any contributions are extremely welcome and appreciated. However, before doing so we do ask that you read the following.

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hux-js/hux-contrax/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Repository Architecture](#repository-architecture)

## Contributing

- Pushing straight to `main` and `develop` branches is disabled.

- All development should be done in branches that are based off of `develop`.

- Please use concise commit messages.

- When pulling in `develop` changes _after_ PR feedback has been given, please merge commit to avoid changing the timeline of the PR rather than rebasing.

- Make sure tests and linting passes before opening a full pull request. This is not a requirement when opening a draft pull request.

- Open a draft pull request to start the feedback cycle early.

- Ensure new code has decent test coverage.
